For the speech recognition you need a microsoft azure key. In the "configfiles" folder which is in the main app folder you find a file named: "AzureAccountTemplate.xml". Copy that file and rename it to: "AzureAccount.xml". Then edit that file with the informations you have from your azure account and save it.

also you need at least one microphone activated as windows main audio input. usually this is the VR Headsets microphone.
