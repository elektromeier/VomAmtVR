The assets folder is not on github as its quite huge (Around 3GB). please download it from here: xxxxx and copy it right in the apps main folder next to this readme file.

For the speech recognition you need an microsoft azure key and copy it to a blank textfile names AzureKey.txt and place it in the main app folder.
also you need at least one microphone activated as windows main audio input. usually this is the VR Headsets microphone.
