The assets folder is not on github as its quite huge (around 3GB). please download it from here: (we need to find a webspace for this) and copy it in the apps main folder next to this readme file.

For the speech recognition you need an microsoft azure key and copy it to a blank textfile named: "AzureKey.txt" and place it in the main app folder.
also you need at least one microphone activated as windows main audio input. usually this is the VR Headsets microphone.
