****Installation Instructions***
-The assets folder is not on github as its quite huge (Around 3GB). please download it from here: 
https://www.bubenhofer.com/telefonzentrale/ 
and copy the folder "assets" right in the apps main folder, next to this readme file.

-For the speech recognition you need a microsoft azure key. In the "configfiles" folder which is in the main app folder you find a file named: "SettingsTemplate.xml". Copy that file and rename it to: "Settings.xml". Please add the informations you got from your azure account and save the settings.xml.

-also you need at least one microphone activated as windows main audio input. usually this is the VR Headsets microphone.

-the audio ou part currently relies on the fruity loops asio driver. therefore you need to download the fruityloops installer and install their asiodrivers. download here: https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-download/
we try to get rid of that in future releases.

-lastly install all the fonts included under assets/fonts to your system.

-download the binaries including the assets here:
